# Employee-Salary-Prediction-Model

This project trains and deploys machine learning models to predict whether an individual's income is >50K or <=50K based on the Adult dataset.

## Key Features:

-   Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical features).
-   Training and evaluation of multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Gradient Boosting).
-   Selection of the best performing model (Gradient Boosting).
-   Deployment of the model using a Streamlit web application for single and batch predictions.

## To run this project:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`, `joblib`, `pickle`, `pyngrok`).
3.  Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`

Feel free to explore the code and the Streamlit application!
